# Express

Express is a popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.  

We don't have to get into details about what it does, let's just make sure it's installed and works on your machine.  
In your terminal:  

`npm install express`

Then open the terminal on VS Code or on this folder and type:  

`node helloexpress.js`
