# Express

Express is a popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.  

We don't have to get into details about what it does, let's just make sure it's installed and works on your machine.  

If you are creating a project from scratch you install it from npm. In your terminal:  

`npm install express`

npm will create a package.json file and add that particular version of express as a *dependency* (installation pre-requirement).

If you are starting from an existing project that requires it, there should be already a package or package-lock.json file in the folder.
You can install it by typing in the terminal:

`npm install`

Then open the terminal on VS Code or on this folder and type:  

`node helloexpress.js`
